Process: An in a programm (e.g. a Python interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs adn cores and
+ Separate memory space -> Memore is not shares between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing and
+ New process is stated independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable by
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation and

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
